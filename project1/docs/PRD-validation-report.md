## Cohesion Validation (Level 2 Greenfield)

### Project Context Detection ✅
- ✅ Level 2 confirmed
- ✅ Greenfield confirmed
- ✅ Appropriate validation sections applied

### Section A: Tech Spec Validation
**Status:** ⏸️ DEFERRED TO SOLUTIONING PHASE

This is appropriate for Level 2 projects - tech spec will be created in next phase via 3-solutioning workflow.

### Section B: Greenfield-Specific Validation ✅

#### B.1 Project Setup Sequencing
- ✅ Epic structure allows for proper setup sequencing
- ⚠️ Recommend adding "Epic 0: Project Setup" OR ensuring Story 1.1/2.1 includes:
  - Repository initialization
  - Development environment setup
  - Dependencies installation
  - Database setup

**Recommendation:** First stories should include infrastructure setup

#### B.2 Infrastructure Before Features
- ✅ Logical sequencing apparent in stories
- ✅ Authentication (Story 2.1) before protected features (2.2-2.6)
- ✅ Input field (1.1) before suggestion API (1.2)
- ✅ Template engine (1.3) before language processing (1.4)

#### B.3 External Dependencies
- ✅ User assigned sample data acquisition (D2)
- ✅ Hosting/infrastructure noted (D3)
- ⚠️ Dutch NLP library selection should happen early in solutioning

**Action Item:** Prioritize NLP library research in tech spec phase

### Section D: Feature Sequencing ✅

#### D.1 Functional Dependencies
- ✅ Authentication before admin features
- ✅ Input field before suggestion generation
- ✅ Data model before associations
- ✅ Logical user flow progression

#### D.2 Technical Dependencies
- ✅ Core API before client consumption
- ✅ Template engine before suggestion generation
- ✅ Data validation before CRUD operations

#### D.3 Epic Dependencies
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Epics can be developed in parallel (good for Level 2)
- ✅ Epic 1 and Epic 2 are independent

### Section E: UI/UX Cohesion ✅

#### E.1 Design System (Greenfield)
- ⚠️ UI framework selection deferred to tech spec (acceptable)
- ✅ UX principles defined
- ✅ Responsive design implied (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Accessibility requirements explicit (NFR002)

**Strong Recommendation:** Run UX specification workflow given project emphasis on UX exploration

#### E.3 UX Flow Validation
- ✅ User journey mapped completely
- ✅ Navigation pattern clear (search → suggestions → results)
- ✅ Error states planned (Story 1.6)
- ⚠️ Form validation needs detail in tech spec

### Section F: Responsibility Assignment ✅

- ✅ Sample data acquisition → User (D2)
- ✅ Hosting setup → User (D3)
- ✅ All code tasks → Developer
- ✅ Clear separation

### Section G: Documentation Readiness ⚠️

- ⚠️ Setup instructions will be created during development
- ⚠️ API documentation plan needed (Story 1.2)
- ✅ Patterns will emerge from tech spec

**Recommendation:** Include API documentation in tech spec

### Section H: Future-Proofing ✅

#### H.1 Extensibility
- ✅ Current vs future clearly separated (out-of-scope section)
- ✅ Architecture principles support future enhancements
- ✅ Experimentation-first architecture (UX Principle 5)

#### H.2 Observability
- ⚠️ Monitoring strategy should be added to tech spec
- ✅ Success metrics defined (user perception, discovery success)
- ⚠️ Analytics/tracking approach should be clarified

---

## Quality Checks ✅

- ✅ Requirements are strategic, not implementation-focused
- ✅ Maintains appropriate abstraction level
- ✅ No premature technical decisions
- ✅ Focus on WHAT, not HOW

---

## Readiness for Next Phase ✅

## Critical Recommendations

### Must Do (Before Development Starts):

1. **Run Solutioning Workflow** - Create tech spec with:
   - Tech stack selection (framework, database, Dutch NLP library)
   - Source tree structure
   - Performance strategy for <200ms requirement
   - API documentation plan

2. **Run UX Specification Workflow** - Given Frank's emphasis on exploring multiple UX approaches:
   - Create multiple UX prototypes
   - Define interaction patterns
   - Establish component library
   - Plan A/B testing strategy

3. **Acquire Sample Dataset** - Prioritize D2:
   - 5-10 sample gemeentes
   - 20-30 sample services
   - Seed data for testing

### Should Do (Recommended):

4. **Add Epic 0 or enhance Story 1.1/2.1** with infrastructure setup tasks

5. **Define monitoring strategy** in tech spec for observability

6. **Include API documentation** plan in tech spec

### Nice to Have:

7. Consider additional user personas for journey validation

8. Document expected analytics/tracking in tech spec
