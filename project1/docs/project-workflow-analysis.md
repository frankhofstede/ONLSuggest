# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Project:** ONLSuggest-v1
**Analyst:** Frank

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Web application
- **Project Level:** Level 2 (Small complete system)
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-med.md

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Query suggestion system for Dutch government services (gemeente). Citizens enter partial queries and receive question-based suggestions to help them find municipal services. The system will feature an admin interface for manual dataset management to keep initial complexity manageable while exploring various UX approaches.
- **Estimated Stories:** 8-12 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 1-2 epics
- **Timeline:** 4-8 weeks for MVP

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Greenfield (fresh start with brainstorming phase)
- **Existing Documentation:** None (starting from scratch)
- **Team Size:** Not specified (assumed small team/solo)
- **Deployment Intent:** Government service platform

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)** - Focused scope for Level 2 project
2. **Epic Stories Document** - 1-2 epics with detailed user stories
3. **Tech Spec** - Technical implementation details following PRD completion
4. **UX Specification** - Multiple UX approaches to explore (critical for this project)

### Workflow Sequence

1. Complete PRD using instructions-med.md (focused PRD for small systems)
2. Generate epic-stories.md with detailed user stories
3. Proceed to solutioning workflow (3-solutioning) for:
   - UX specification exploration (multiple approaches)
   - Technical specification
   - Architecture decisions

### Next Actions

1. Load and execute PRD workflow with Level 2 context
2. Focus on user research and UX exploration given the brainstorming requirement
3. After PRD approval, transition to solutioning workflow for detailed tech specs

## Special Considerations

- **UX Exploration Priority:** User explicitly wants to brainstorm and test many UX approaches - this should be a major focus area
- **Scope Management:** Keeping dataset management manual in admin interface to avoid complexity creep
- **Target Users:** Dutch citizens searching for municipal services - accessibility and simplicity are critical
- **Language Considerations:** Dutch language support for queries and suggestions
- **Data Strategy:** Manual curation via admin interface (Phase 1), potential automation deferred

## Technical Preferences Captured

- **Admin Interface:** Manual dataset management to control complexity
- **Query Suggestion Approach:** Question-based suggestions (not simple autocomplete)
- **Architecture Philosophy:** Start simple, validate UX first before adding complexity
- **Exploration Focus:** Multiple UX prototypes/approaches before committing to final design
