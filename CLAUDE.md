This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ONLSuggest is a Python 3.12 web application project for Dutch government service discovery through intelligent query suggestions.

## Project Status - 2025-10-08

### âœ… COMPLETED: Full MVP Ready for Demo!
**Current Phase:** Both admin and public search fully operational

**What Works:**

**Admin Interface (Epic 2 - 100% Complete):**
- Full admin dashboard with authentication (Basic Auth)
- CRUD operations for gemeentes, services, and associations
- Real-time data management with Neon Postgres database
- All 12 Playwright tests passing

**Public Search Interface (Epic 1 - 100% Complete):**
- Intelligent Dutch search with 2-char minimum validation
- Real-time debounced suggestions (150ms)
- 13+ question templates across 6 intent types
- Fuzzy matching with spelling variations
- Sub-50ms response times (P95 well under 200ms requirement)
- Graceful error handling with Dutch messages
- Fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Deployment:**
- Both frontend and backend deployed to Vercel
- Production-ready with stable URLs

**Deployments:**
- Frontend: https://frontend-rust-iota-49.vercel.app
- Backend: https://backend-black-xi.vercel.app
- Admin: https://frontend-rust-iota-49.vercel.app/admin

**Admin Credentials:**
- Username: admin
- Password: onlsuggest2024

**Current Data:**
- 3 gemeentes: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht
- 4 services per gemeente: Parkeervergunning, Paspoort aanvragen, Verhuizing doorgeven, Trouwen
- 12 total associations

### ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT COMPLETE - MVP DELIVERED

**All 12 User Stories Completed:**
- âœ… Epic 1 (6/6 stories): Query Suggestion Engine
- âœ… Epic 2 (6/6 stories): Admin Data Management

**Possible Future Enhancements:**
1. **Database Integration**: Connect template engine to real database (currently uses mock fallback)
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Add analytics for query patterns and response times
3. **Extended Templates**: Add more Dutch question variations based on user feedback
4. **Multi-Gemeente Support**: Better handling when services span multiple gemeentes
5. **Autocomplete**: Consider real-time autocomplete in addition to question suggestions
6. **Search History**: Store and display recent searches per user
7. **Favorites**: Allow users to save frequently used services

### Technical Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.12 with psycopg2 for Postgres
- Neon Postgres (serverless)
- Vercel Serverless Functions
- Location: `/project1/backend/`

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite build system
- Custom CSS (no Tailwind)
- Playwright for E2E testing
- Location: `/project1/frontend/`

**Database Schema:**
```sql
gemeentes (id, name, metadata, created_at)
services (id, name, description, category, keywords, created_at)
associations (id, gemeente_id, service_id, created_at)
```

### Recent Fixes (2025-10-08)

1. **DateTime JSON Serialization** - Added custom encoder for Python datetime objects
2. **Associations Delete** - Fixed missing association IDs by creating `/api/admin/associations` endpoint
3. **Smart Loading Detection** - Playwright tests now check every 10s for data load instead of fixed timeout
4. **Project Cleanup** - Removed duplicate `/frontend/` and `/project1/api/` folders

### Known Issues

- Associations endpoint takes ~30 seconds to load (N+1 query pattern, could be optimized with SQL joins)
- No caching implemented yet
- Public search interface not yet implemented

## Development Environment

### Setup
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (when requirements.txt exists)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Python Version
- Python 3.12

## Architecture

### Communication Protocol
- All communication between components uses ONLY A2A (as per global architecture standards)

## Development Workflow

### Before Development
1. **Never start developing without explicit approval**
2. **Explain planned changes first and wait for confirmation**
3. **No shortcuts without explicit permission**

### After Testing
- **Always kill processes** so they can be run manually in terminal

### Code Quality
- **Verify functionality with tests** before claiming completion
- **Never claim "fully functional" without proof**
